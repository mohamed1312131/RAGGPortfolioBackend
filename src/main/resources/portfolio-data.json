    "content": "I'm Mohamed, a software engineer who genuinely loves coding and building real-world projects. I'm always looking for opportunities to work on big, challenging projects where I can learn, grow, and actually make an impact. I care about the little details in my code—sometimes that even means initializing age as a short instead of an int just to optimize performance. Writing efficient, clean, and maintainable code is something I take seriously.\nI have experience with multiple programming languages, including C++, Java, and Python, and I've built several projects using Spring Boot and Angular. I'm comfortable working with databases like MongoDB, PostgreSQL, SQL, Cassandra, Redis, and even newer tools like ChromaDB. I've also explored some machine learning concepts like vector embeddings and RAG, using them to make applications smarter and more dynamic.\nOn the DevOps side, I know my way around CI/CD tools like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, and SonarQube, and I'm familiar with testing frameworks like JUnit and Mockito. I've also worked with Docker, Kubernetes, Kafka, and cloud platforms like Azure, which makes me confident in deploying and managing applications end-to-end.\nI'm the kind of person who loves figuring things out, learning new technologies, and making code better wherever I can. I focus on performance, scalability, and real-world usability, and I'm always looking for ways to improve both myself and the projects I work on.\nIn short, I'm a hands-on, performance-focused engineer who's excited about building meaningful software and being part of a team that tackles real-life challenges.",

I had to learn about semantic search, ChromaDB, embedding models, and how to architect a system where the AI responses are grounded in actual data rather than hallucinations. Managing the Docker containers, scripting the data ingestion pipeline, and debugging why certain queries weren't retrieving the right documents took a lot of trial and error. Another major challenge was implementing the blockchain-based medical record access control in FullCare_App using Hedera Hashgraph. Working with NFTs, understanding the Hedera Token Service, and ensuring secure, decentralized access to sensitive medical data required me to think completely differently about authentication and authorization.

I want a role where I'm constantly learning, where I have to deep dive into backend performance optimization, distributed systems, caching strategies, database scaling, and microservices orchestration. I thrive in environments where the problems are hard and the stakes are high. I don't want to just maintain existing systems—I want to build, improve, and architect solutions that handle real-world scale. That's where I see myself growing the most, and that's the kind of work that excites me.",

I understand the core concepts deeply—dependency injection, Spring's IoC container, AOP, Spring Data JPA, Spring Security, building RESTful APIs, exception handling, validation, and testing with JUnit and Mockito. I've built multiple production-level applications with Spring Boot, and I'm comfortable working with Spring Cloud for microservices, including service discovery, API gateways, and distributed configuration. I can debug complex issues, optimize performance, and design clean, maintainable architectures. When it comes to backend development, I know what I'm doing, and I can pick up new frameworks or languages quickly because I understand the underlying principles.",

    "content": "One of my key achievements at The Hive was reducing the budget of our ticket resolution pipeline. The company was spending heavily on ServiceNow ticket resolution time, and I identified inefficiencies in our workflow. By streamlining the investigation process, creating internal documentation, and automating repetitive debugging steps, I was able to significantly cut down resolution time. This directly reduced costs, and the company was very happy with the results. It taught me that even in a support role, there's always room to improve processes and add value beyond just resolving tickets.",
