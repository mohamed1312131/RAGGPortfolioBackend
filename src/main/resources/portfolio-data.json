    "content": "I'm Mohamed, a software engineer who genuinely loves coding and building real-world projects. I'm always looking for opportunities to work on big, challenging projects where I can learn, grow, and actually make an impact. I care about the little details in my code—sometimes that even means initializing age as a short instead of an int just to optimize performance. Writing efficient, clean, and maintainable code is something I take seriously.\nI have experience with multiple programming languages, including C++, Java, and Python, and I've built several projects using Spring Boot and Angular. I'm comfortable working with databases like MongoDB, PostgreSQL, SQL, Cassandra, Redis, and even newer tools like ChromaDB. I've also explored some machine learning concepts like vector embeddings and RAG, using them to make applications smarter and more dynamic.\nOn the DevOps side, I know my way around CI/CD tools like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, and SonarQube, and I'm familiar with testing frameworks like JUnit and Mockito. I've also worked with Docker, Kubernetes, Kafka, and cloud platforms like Azure, which makes me confident in deploying and managing applications end-to-end.\nI'm the kind of person who loves figuring things out, learning new technologies, and making code better wherever I can. I focus on performance, scalability, and real-world usability, and I'm always looking for ways to improve both myself and the projects I work on.\nIn short, I'm a hands-on, performance-focused engineer who's excited about building meaningful software and being part of a team that tackles real-life challenges.",
